								<span>T</span>he boy's name was Santiago. Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his
								herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an
								enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once
								stood. <br>
								He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered
								through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the
								flock from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the
								region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had
								had to spend the entire next day searching for it. <br>
								He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just
								finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start
								reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable
								pillows. <br>
								It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars
								through the half-destroyed roof. <br>
								
								I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream
								that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended. <br>
								He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still
								slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also
								began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of
								the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them
								through the countryside in search of food and water. "They are so used to
								me that they know my schedule," he muttered. Thinking about that for a
								moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he
								who had become accustomed to their schedule.
								<br>
								But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy
								prodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name. He had
								always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So
								there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an
								impression on him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the
								happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes he would comment to
								them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed. <br>
								But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the
								girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in
								about four days. He had been to the village only once, the year before. The
								merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded
								that the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be
								cheated. A friend had told the boy about the shop, and he had taken his
								sheep there. <br> <br>
								* <br> <br>
								"<span>I</span> need to sell some wool," the boy told the merchant.
								The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the
								afternoon. <br> So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from
								his bag. <br>
								"I didn't know shepherds knew how to read," said a girl's voice behind him.
								The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing black hair, and
								eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors. <br>
								"Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books," he answered.
								During the two hours that they talked, she told him she was the merchant's
								daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where each day was like all the
								others. The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside, and related the
								news from the other towns where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change
								from talking to his sheep. <br>
								"How did you learn to read?" the girl asked at one point. <br>
								"Like everybody learns," he said. "In school." <br>
								"Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?" <br>
								The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her
								question. He was sure the girl would never understand. He went on telling
								stories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear
								and surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the
								day would never end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting
								for three days. He recognized that he was feeling something he had never
								experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl with
								the raven hair, his days would never be the same again. <br>
								But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep.
								He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following
								year.
